# Bamazon-App

## Bamazon is an Amazon-like storefront that utilizes a MySQL database to store product information, and Node.JS to take in commands from Managers and Customers alike.  Using the command line, customers can view the store's inventory and purchase the products they desire.  The app will automatically adjust the store's inventory and give the customer a total for their purchases.  In addition, managment can use the command line to manage their inventory.  The app allows management the ability to view the store's inventory, view products that are low and need to be reordered, add products that are currently offered, and add new products to the store's inventory.
