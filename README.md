# Liri-Node-App

## LIRI is a _Language_ Interpretation and Recognition Interface. LIRI is a command line node app that takes in parameters and gives you back data.  More specifically, this app searches Spotify for songs, the Bands in Town API for concerts, and the OMDB API for movies.

## This application gives users the ability to search for information about specific songs, movies, or concert events that they might be interested in.  Using the command line, users will input one of the following commands:  "spotify-this-song","concert-this", "movie-this", or "do-what-it-says".  These phrases tell LIRI what kind of search it should be performing as well as where it should retrieve the requested information.  Afterwards, the user will type in the name of a song, an upcoming concert, or a movie they would like to learn about.  For example, if a user wants to learn about a song, they would type "spotify-this-song" followed by the name of the song and press enter.  The "do-what-it-says" command reads information from a text file and does not require any additional input.  However, if the user would like to edit the file (random.txt), they are free to do so.
